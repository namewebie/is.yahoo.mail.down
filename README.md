## How do we check if Yahoo Mail is down?

1) We check the Yahoo Mail server to see if it is responding and we do this from a region closest to you. This test we perform simulates what an actual web browser (e.g. Safari, Chrome, Firefox) would do when trying to visit the website.

2) We determine if the Yahoo Mail server is returning an error message that indicates some sort of problem. These types of errors generally mean that a visitor -- you -- would also have trouble using or visiting the service.

3) We return the results of our test from our servers and let you know if Yahoo Mail is up or down.
